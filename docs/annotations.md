# Annotations

The following annotations are used by the operator to control the injection and define configuration of the flagd sidecar.

### `openfeature.dev/enabled`
When a value of `"true"` is provided, the operator will inject a flagd sidecar into the annotated pods.  
Example: 
```yaml
    metadata:
    annotations:
      openfeature.dev/enabled: "true"
```

### `openfeature.dev/flagsourceconfiguration`
This annotation specifies the names of the FlagSourceConfigurations used to configure the injected flagd sidecar.
The annotation value is a comma separated list of values following one of 2 patterns: {NAME} or {NAMESPACE}/{NAME}. 
If no namespace is provided it is assumed that the CR is within the same namespace as the deployed pod.
If multiple CRs are provided, they are merged with the latest taking precedence, for example, in the scenario below, `config-B` will take priority in the merge, replacing duplicated values that are set in `config-A`.

Example:
```yaml
  metadata:
    annotations:
      openfeature.dev/enabled: "true"
      openfeature.dev/flagsourceconfiguration: "config-A, config-B"
```

### `openfeature.dev/allowkubernetessync`
*This annotation is used internally by the operator.*  
This annotation is used to mark pods which should have their permissions backfilled in the event of an upgrade. When the OFO manager pod is started, all `Service Accounts` of any `Pods` with this annotation set to `"true"` will be added to the `flagd-kubernetes-sync` `Cluster Role Binding`.


### `openfeature.dev/featureflagconfiguration`
*This annotation is DEPRECATED in favour of the `openfeature.dev/flagsourceconfiguration` annotation and should no longer be used.* 
This annotation specifies the names of the FeatureFlagConfigurations used to configure the injected flagd sidecar.
The annotation value is a comma separated list of values following one of 2 patterns: {NAME} or {NAMESPACE}/{NAME}. 
If no namespace is provided it is assumed that the CR is within the same namespace as the deployed pod.
Example:
```yaml
    metadata:
    annotations:
      openfeature.dev/enabled: "true"
      openfeature.dev/featureflagconfiguration: "demo, test/demo-2"
```

### `openfeature.dev`
*This annotation is DEPRECATED in favour of the `openfeature.dev/enabled` annotation and should no longer be used.* 

When a value of `"enabled"` is provided, the operator will inject a flagd sidecar into the annotated pods.  
Example: 
```yaml
    metadata:
    annotations:
      openfeature.dev: "enabled"
```
