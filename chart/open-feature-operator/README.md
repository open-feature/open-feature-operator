## Introduction

The OpenFeature Operator is a Kubernetes native operator that allows you to expose feature flags to your applications. It injects a [flagd](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd) sidecar into your pod and allows you to poll the flagd server for feature flags in a variety of ways.
The full documentation for this project can be found here: [OpenFeature Operator](https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/tree/main/docs)
